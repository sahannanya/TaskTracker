# TaskTracker
Usecase : To record a person's activities for a particular time.
The app would be listening for audio input at set intervals. It would listen for a short time, then process the audio for keywords. 
If audio recognizition fails, app prompts another beep and records raw audio instead. 
User can set the time duration they want to track their task. Eg: Every day from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM. 
Right now the default frequency is once in 10 mins.


How to use the code:
1. Download from the repo
2. Open in Android Studio and build app
3. Give permissions to the app, let it run in background.



Note: This is a demo application for activity annotation, covering only the scheduling of alarms logic.
